## Rationale

Do you want to be typing that redundant welcome message 
each time a new user joins your telegram group ?
I bet you don't! This bot saves you the time and stress of having 
to do that. It watches for when new members are added to 
a telgram group; when that happens, being the nice _thing_ that it is :smiley:
it automatically greets them with a friendly welcome message.

## oh okay I gerrit. So how do I add this bot to my telegram group

* first of all, go to contacts on your telegram app. From the contact screen, search for @DaigonBot. A bot with the display name @friend and the username @DaigonBot should appear. 

* Tap on the bot's name. You should be taken to a chat window where you could have convos with the bot

* In the chat window, tap on the bot's name again to view its info. You should then see a screen like the one below

* on the bot's detail page(refer to image above), click the three-dot menu icon. There should be an option for adding it to a group as shown in the image below
