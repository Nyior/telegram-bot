## Rationale

Do you want to be typing that redundant welcome message 
each time a new user joins your telegram group ?
I bet you don't! This bot saves you the time and stress of having 
to do that. It watches for when new members are added to 
a telgram group and it automatically shows them a welcome message.

## oh okay I gerrit. So how do I add this bot to my telegram group

* first of all, navigate to your telegram app search field and search for @DaigonBot, and a bot with the display name @friend and the username @DaigonBot should appear. 

* tap on the bot's name. You should be taken to a chat window where you could have convos with the bot

* tap on the bot's name again to view its details. You should then see a screen like the one below
